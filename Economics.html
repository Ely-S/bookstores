<h1>The Economic Side</h1>
<br/>
<p>First, here is a background on the economics for those of us not familiar with the details. For this project we focused mainly on the supply and demand relationship. Supply is how much of a certain item is available. Demand is how much of that item is demanded by the public. Where these two lines meet is the equilibrium. These two items are connected in that when one changes the other changes.</p>
<p>For example: 
<ul>
<li>If Demand Increases: price increases, quantity increases.  </li>
<li>If Demand Decreases: price decreases, quantity decreases. </li>
<li>If Supply Increases: price decreases, quantity increases. </li>
<li>If Supply Decreases: price increases, quantity decreases. </li>
</ul>
<br/>
</p>
<p>Steven Lehigh, an Economics professor at College of San Mateo, explained some of the possible reasons for bookstores going out of business. The first of which is the substitution of e-books for hard copy books. As the demand for hard copy books decrease, the prices of the books start to decrease. Bookstores which were already down to their bare minimums will be forced to shut down because the same number of sales will no longer cover the expenses of the store. </p>
<p>Another contributing factor to the decline for small bookstores is costs for operation. Local bookstores have more expenses, like the cost of shipping the books from the publishers, handling expenses, rent, utility, employees, merchandising costs, ; whereas, Online stores incur very low expenses because they are able to house books in a warehouse anywhere in the world and do not have to worry about merchandising costs and high rent for profitable locations.</p>
<p>As profits from books decrease as the demand decreases, large retailers are being affected, but their profits were high enough before that the fluctuation in the market does not put them out of business. In the case of the small bookstore, however, their profits were low enough to start that when the market shifted, some stores had to close and others became in high risk to close. The large stores also curbed their losses in the hard-copy market by supplementing their profits with a shift into the e-book market.</p>
<p>Many stores admitted that Amazon and other large retailers stood as their biggest competitors and that they are able to survive by finding a place in a niche market, like foreign language, religious, antique, or specialty books.</p>
