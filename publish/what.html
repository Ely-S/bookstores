<h1>What You Can Do</h1>
<br/>
<p>If you search the decline of bookstores online many people are trying to start the conversation through blogs and articles, but only if the average person joins the fight will we be able to make a difference. There are many simple things that if everyone were to do every now and then, we as a population can turn around the imminent closure of all local book stores.</p>
<p>Marc Lamont Hill stated, "I must begrudgingly concede that the traditional bookstore model has become economically unsustainable. Its death, while tragic, is unavoidable." (<a href=http://articles.philly.com/2011-09-28/news/30213151_1_books-matter-bookstores-borders">http://articles.philly.com/2011-09-28/news/30213151_1_books-matter-bookstores-borders</a>)</p>
<p>People say that the concept of bookstores is obsolete, but if there is a chance to save them, why not? Anyone can give up and not fight. The strong fight even if there might not be a chance to succeed. Fight for your local bookstores.</p>
<h2>Things that YOU can do to help:</h2>
<ul class="list">
<li>Visit a local bookstore.</li>
<li>Small bookstores compete with larger chains by carrying vintage, out of print, and other niche books that might not be able to be found online.</li>
<li>The owner or workers can recommend books depending on your interests and can help you discover something amazing that you never would have thought to read.</li>
<li>If you find a store you like, spread the word</li>
<li>People underestimate the power of advertising by word of mouth and too often people don't think to share the good experiences.</li>
<li>Go on Yelp or your favorite social media site and tell people why you love your local bookstore.</li>
<li>Choose retailers that partner with large corporations</li>
<li>Some local bookstores remain in business due to selling books online through Barnes and Noble or Amazon</li>
<li>When shopping it will be listed where your book comes from, so make sure to help out a small store even when you try to get a great deal</li>
<li>Books can be meaningful gifts</li>
<li>Maybe you know someone who has a birthday coming up, get a copy of your relative's favorite childhood story, a book of poems by your friend's favorite poet, love quotes for a partner or maybe a scandalous romance novel as a joke for a best friend. At a bookstore, the possibilities are endless.</li>
<li>Rather than a Barnes and Noble gift-card, see if your local bookstore has a certificate or gift-card.</li>
<li>Other wonderful features of Printed books</li>
<li>No batteries needed</li>
<li>You can read on a plane even during takeoff and landing</li>
<li>You don't have to worry about spilling Marinara on your kindle in the kitchen</li>
</ul>
